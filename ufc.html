            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                In our research, we set out to predict the outcomes of UFC fights using comprehensive fighter statistics from 1993 to 2021, 
                encompassing 6012 observations and 155 variables per fight. 
                Our primary objective was to determine which fighter variables could effectively predict fight outcomes. 
                To achieve this, we divided our dataset into infight and career data subsets. Utilizing binomial logistic regression 
                for infight predictions, we analyzed variables like differences in height, weight, age, strike percentage, headshot percentage, 
                and body shot percentage between fighters. Although the difference in strike percentage proved significant, the model's error rate 
                of 0.316 highlighted its limited predictive power. For career predictions, we employed linear regression to explore the 
                relationship between win ratios and various explanatory variables, including strikes, headshots, body shots, weight, height, 
                reach, and age. Despite significant p-values, the models exhibited low R-squared values, indicating weak predictive relationships. 
                Multiple linear regression, incorporating categorical variables such as weight class and stance, marginally improved the model's 
                adjusted R-squared to 0.097. Through this project, we developed skills in classification analysis, logistic and linear regression, 
                and statistical modeling, laying the groundwork for future studies that will refine predictive accuracy by analyzing weight class
                and gender separately, incorporating more complex variables, and employing advanced modeling techniques.

            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                In our research, we aimed to predict the outcomes of UFC fights based on fighter statistics.
                The dataset we chose includes UFC fights and fighter statistics from 1993 to 2021. 
                Each observation in the dataset represents a fight, including individual fighter stats, 
                totaling 6012 observations with 155 variables. 
                Our primary scientific question was: "Which fighter variables predict wins?" To answer this, 
                we split our dataset into two subsets: infight data and career data.

            <h2>Solution:</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                We conducted classification analysis and linear regression to draw conclusions from our data. 
                For infight predictions, we used binomial logistic regression with explanatory variables such as differences in height, 
                weight, age, strike percentage, headshot percentage, and body shot percentage between fighters. 
                We found that the difference in strike percentage was significant at an alpha level of 0.05, 
                with an AIC of 15904. However, the model's error rate was 0.316, indicating poor predictive power.
            </p>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                For the career dataset, we used linear regression to find relationships between win ratio 
                (number of wins over number of fights) and explanatory variables like proportion of strikes, 
                headshots, body shots, weight, height, reach, and age. The linear regressions had significant p-values, 
                but the R-squared values were low (0.0025-0.047), indicating weak relationships. Multiple linear regression, 
                including categorical variables like weight class and stance, improved the adjusted R-squared to 0.097, 
                but this was still not sufficient for strong predictions.
