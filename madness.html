            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                This project aimed to create a visually appealing platform to display March Madness data, 
                making it easier for users to understand and analyze the tournament's statistics and outcomes. 
                The challenge was to develop a tool that could effectively present complex March Madness data intuitively and engagingly, 
                enabling users to quickly grasp key insights and trends. To address this, 
                I developed a series of static visualizations using data from the tournament. 
                The project involved extensive data processing and the creation of detailed graphics using tools such as Matplotlib in Python. 
                These static graphics were then integrated into a web-based platform for easy access. 
                This approach allowed me to effectively showcase historical data and key statistics, 
                helping users to better understand the patterns and outcomes of the tournament.
