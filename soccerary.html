            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                As a passionate soccer fan in America, I identified a significant gap in the market: 
                there was no single platform that aggregated all soccer matches from around the globe. 
                This observation led to the creation of Soccerary, an all-in-one solution designed to cater to the needs of soccer enthusiasts by providing 
                comprehensive match information and live updates in one place. Soccerary offers live match updates on its homepage, ensuring fans never miss
                out on the action, and provides detailed information on every league and competition, both club and international. 
                Built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, the platform ensures a smooth, interactive, and intuitive user experience. 
                Throughout the development of Soccerary, I honed skills in API integration, web development, and user experience design. 
                Future plans for Soccerary include enhancing the website’s design for a more professional look, incorporating in-depth statistics 
                and analytics for matches and players, 
                and adding links to official league websites and other relevant resources to provide users with direct access to additional information.

            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                As a huge soccer fan in America, I found there was no single platform where one could view all soccer matches

                This gap in the market inspired me to create Soccerary, an all-in-one solution for soccer fans.
