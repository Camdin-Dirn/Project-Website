            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                This project explores the historical trends in NFL franchise value and identifies teams that have struggled to keep up with the 
                league's rapid growth. The NFL, known for its massive revenue and top-ranked franchises, has seen significant value increases.
                By analyzing these trends, the project aims to uncover key factors driving franchise value growth and highlight teams facing stagnation.
                The findings will offer valuable insights into the dynamics of
                NFL franchise economics and provide guidance for other sports leagues on strategies for enhancing team value.

                We had two main research question we want answer. What are the historical trends of NFL franchise value?
                Which teams have struggled to keep up with league growth trends and what are the key factors causing this stagnation?

            <h3 id = 'indent'>Data Collection:</h3>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                Data for this project were sourced from various reputable platforms, including Pro Football Focus, Forbes, and the NFLPA report
                cards, among others. A Docker container with a Python script was used to web scrape and clean data from online sources, 
                converting raw JSON data into structured CSV files.
                The analysis focused on the 2012-2023 NFL seasons, and no further data updates were needed. An SQLite database was chosen 
                for its simplicity and efficiency in data sharing. The database was organized into Third Normal Form using a Snowflake Schema, 
                with relational keys ensuring data integrity. A central team table streamlined queries and maintained consistency. 
                The database integrates seamlessly with R Studio and Python notebooks, facilitating efficient analysis and reporting.

            <h3 id = 'indent'>Data Visualization:</h3>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                R was used to create data visualization to give a clear picture what data we had and what direction the project should go.

            <h3 id = 'indent'>Data Modeling and Machine Learning:</h3>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                R and Python was used to create many model to help understand how variables would effect value over time.
