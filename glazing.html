            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                Glazing Guru addresses challenges in the glazing industry by enhancing communication between estimators and installers. 
                It provides essential project details for efficient installations and reduces errors, serving as a portal for seamless access 
                and boundless opportunities.

            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                My father owns two glass companies in Missoula, MT, 
                where I worked as an installer during the summers of 2022 and 2023.
                Throughout my time on various jobs, ranging from commercial to residential projects and even minor repair work around Missoula, 
                a consistent issue emerged: poor communication. To address this, I developed an app to bridge this communication gap.

            </p>

        <section id="visualization">
            <h2>Solution:</h2>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                GlazingGuru Pro is the solution designed to address this communication challenge. 
                Built by an installer for installers, GlazingGuru leverages my domain knowledge to improve communication across all levels of 
                a glass installation project.

            <h3 id = 'indent'>Project Management by Estimators:</h3>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                Estimators can add new projects when they go out to make estimates.
                They can upload photos of each window (both interior and exterior), add detailed notes on each window,
                and provide general notes about the house and its occupants.
                Essential contact details such as the customer's phone number, name, and address can be included.
            </p>
            <h3 id = 'indent'>Preparation for Installers:</h3>
            <p id = 'indent'>
                Before heading to a job site, installers can review all the details and photos uploaded by the estimator.
                This pre-visit information allows installers to prepare adequately, ensuring they have the necessary materials and tools, 
                thus reducing unnecessary prep time on-site and minimizing extra trips back to the shop.
                By facilitating better communication and preparation, GlazingGuru Pro enhances overall efficiency and quality of work
